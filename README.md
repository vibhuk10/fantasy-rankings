## üìà Ranking Algorithm

### Composite Scoring System

The application uses weighted composite scoring based on position-specific metrics:

#### QB Scoring Weights
- Pass Attempts: 15% (Volume)
- Completion Percentage: 10% (Efficiency)
- Yards per Attempt: 15% (Efficiency)
- Pass TDs: 20% (Scoring)
- Rushing Yards: 15% (Rushing upside)
- Rushing TDs: 10% (Rushing scoring)
- Fantasy PPG: 15% (Overall production)

#### RB Scoring Weights
- Rush Attempts: 20% (Volume)
- Yards per Rush: 15% (Efficiency)
- Rush TDs: 20% (Scoring)
- Targets: 15% (Receiving volume)
- Catch Rate: 10% (Receiving efficiency)
- Fantasy PPG: 20% (Overall production)

#### WR Scoring Weights
- Targets: 20% (Volume)
- Receptions: 15% (Volume)
- Yards per Reception: 15% (Efficiency)
- Receiving TDs: 20% (Scoring)
- Catch Rate: 10% (Efficiency)
- Fantasy PPG: 20% (Overall production)

#### TE Scoring Weights
- Targets: 20% (Volume)
- Receptions: 15% (Volume)
- Yards per Reception: 15% (Efficiency)
- Receiving TDs: 20% (Scoring)
- Catch Rate: 10% (Efficiency)
- Fantasy PPG: 20% (Overall production)

## üîß Development

### Data Fetching
The application automatically fetches real 2024 season data on first run and caches it locally. To refresh the data:

1. Delete the cache file: `backend/data/cache/2024_season_data.json`
2. Restart the backend server

### Adding New Metrics
1. Update the data fetcher in `backend/services/dataFetcher.js`
2. Add the metric to the ranking algorithm in `backend/utils/rankingEngine.js`
3. Update the frontend table configuration in `frontend/src/components/RankingsTable.js`

### Customizing Rankings
Modify the scoring weights in `backend/utils/rankingEngine.js` to adjust the importance of different metrics.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend won't start**
   - Check Node.js version (requires 12+)
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Check port 5000 is available

2. **Frontend won't start**
   - Check Node.js version (requires 12+)
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Check port 3000 is available

3. **No data displayed**
   - Check backend is running on port 5000
   - Check browser console for CORS errors
   - Verify API endpoints are responding

4. **Data fetching errors**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify data source websites are accessible
   - Check for rate limiting from data sources

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting environment variables:
```bash
DEBUG=true npm start
```

## üìù API Documentation

### Response Format
All API endpoints return JSON in the following format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...],
  "message": "Description of response"
}
```

### Error Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error description",
  "message": "Detailed error message"
}
```
